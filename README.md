# Time series forecasting
There are lots of [classical time series forecasting methods](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-methods-in-python-cheat-sheet/), AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, VAR, VARMA, VARMAX, SES and HWES, ARCH, GARCH, HMM. Some of them are new to me, so please let me know if I made any mistakes.

Based on Google Trends' popularity, the following five methods are the most popular ones worldwide in past five years
1. [HMM](https://biran.github.io/Overview-of-time-series-forecasting/hmm) (Hidden Markov model)
2. [ARIMA](https://biran.github.io/Overview-of-time-series-forecasting/arima) (Autoregressive integrated moving average)
3. [Exponential Smoothing](https://biran.github.io/Overview-of-time-series-forecasting/esm) (Exponential smoothing)
4. [ARCH](https://biran.github.io/Overview-of-time-series-forecasting/arch/) (Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity)
5. [VAR](https://biran.github.io/Overview-of-time-series-forecasting/var) (Vector autoregression)
